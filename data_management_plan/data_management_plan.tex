        {\Large {\bf Data Management Plan}}
    \end{center}

    % This Data Management Plan describes how the PIs on this collaborative project will manage, share, preserve, and provide access to data generated by this project at three locations.

    % \subsection*{Types of Data Produced}
    % This project may produce three main types of products:
    % (1) high-quality research articles summarizing the results of the proposed work,
    % (2) software programs that aid in the research,
    % (3) curricular materials for molecular programming courses, workshops, tutorials, outreach presentations, and hands-on outreach demonstrations and short courses.
    
    % Software programs may include prototype development environments for chemical reaction networks to demonstrate and analyze new techniques for molecular programming, prototypes of serious games that direct development or generate chemical reaction networks, simulators and other software tools that aid in the proposed research.
    
    % Curricular materials to be produced include course modules on molecular programming, workshop modules and exercises, and tutorials.  
    
    % \subsection*{Data Archiving and Preservation}
    % All research materials including research results, publications, software, and curricular materials will be kept in version controlled repositories at Drake University, Iowa State University, and Grinnell College.
    % All three of these repositories will be regularly synchronized at a rate of at least once a day.
    % In addition,  the Iowa State University repository will be backed up off-site once a day.
    % Data stored at each of the collaborative institution site will be secured according to each institutions standard practices for securing data.
    % It is not anticipated that any sensitive, private, or confidential data will be collected.
    
    % Only the PIs, the undergraduate student research participants, graduate student research participants, any collaborators on the project will be granted access to these repositories.
    
    % The data will be retained for the period of the grant and will be made available to the public once archival publications are generated and accepted for publication.  Regardless of publication, all data materials will be publicly released within two years of the closing of the grant-funded activity.
    
    % \subsection*{Data Dissemination}
    % The research from this project will be published in conferences, journals, workshops, and at educational outreach programs. 
    % Any software programs developed for this research will be made available using public repositories such as Github.
    % World Wide Web links to the software programs and research papers from the proposed research will be made available on web servers at each of the three PIs institutions.
