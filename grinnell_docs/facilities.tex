The PI will carry out the proposed work at Grinnell College which possesses all of the facilities required to complete the project.

The PI and their students will work from Grinnell College's Robert N. Noyce '49 Science Center.
The Science Center is a state-of-the-art facility featuring over 80 GNU/Linux workstations in addition to several Windows and Macintosh workstations that are distributed among several computer labs for student use.
These machines (collectively known as MathLAN) are networked together and to the wider campus network via optical fiber; the college maintains a high-speed link to the Internet.
The PI also possesses a private computer lab in the building for use by his research group.
This lab provides the PI's current students a private place to perform research and is stocked with several MathLAN workstations as well.

The Grinnell College library supports the PI's scholarship by maintaining subscriptions to relevant journals and digital libraries.
The College's Information Technology Services (ITS) group provides the PI with IT support.
