\section*{Dissemination of Research Results}
Research results from this project will be submitted for peer review to top-tier programming languages conferences and affiliated workshops, including:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0em]
  \item Principles of Programming Languages (POPL),
  \item Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI),
  \item International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP), and
  \item Systems, Programming, Language and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH),
\end{itemize}
When possible, all publications will made open access to maximize the accessibility and impact of the work.
Pre-prints of published results will also be made available on the PI's website.

\section*{Dissemination of Artifacts}
The artifacts that will be generated during the course of this project include various software packages and their source code, \eg, program synthesizers or IDE plugins to support semi-automated programming.
Artifacts will be stored for developmental purposes on internal servers supported by the PI's institution as well as online project management services such as Github.
Finally, these artifacts will be made available via the PI's academic web page using appropriate open source and creative commons licenses so that interested parties may utilize, inspect, and build upon the work.
