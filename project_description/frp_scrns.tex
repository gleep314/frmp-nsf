\section{FRP and Stochastic CRNs}
\label{sec:frp_scrns}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%o

When modeling molecular interactions in small volumes, the deterministic chemical reaction network model is often insufficient.
Consider a volume the size of a mammalian cell where the presence or absence of a single molecule may affect the entire behavior of the cell.
Chemical systems in these environments are inherently probabilistic, and as a result modeling chemical reaction networks with \emph{stochastic mass action kinetics} is appropriate.
In a stochastic CRN, molecular counts are modeled discretely, and therefore a state of the CRN consists of a vector of integers.
Stochastic CRNs are equivalent to many well-known models such as vector addition systems, Petri nets, and population protocols CITE.
\todo{CITE}

Molecular programmers commonly use stochastic CRNs in one of two ways.
The first approach is to use a \emph{leader molecule} to help direct the computation.
Use of leaders are important in many distributed computing algorithms and have been thoroughly investigated in the population protocol model CITE \todo{CITE}.
In the context of a stochastic CRN, a leader molecule is used to enable and disable target stages of the computation to guarantee modularity and prevent interference from different parts of the program.
Commonly only one leader molecule exists in the solution at a time, and when one stage of the computation finishes, it decays into a new leader molecule that enables the next part of the algorithm.
Note that such a technique is impossible in a deterministic CRN because a species with strictly positive concentration will remain positive forever.
The second approach is to embrace the stochasticity of the model and harness it to perform computation.
For example, in CITE \todo{CITE}, the authors exploit the stochastic nature of these CRNs to implement arbitrary probability distributions at the nanoscale.
In CITE, the author uses randomness to efficiently and robustly solve a variety of search problems via a random walk augmented with various heuristics \todo{CITE and double check that this is true}.
Programming stochastic CRNs in this way often involves 

Since programming with stochastic CRNs is fundamentally different than with deterministic CRNs, the use of functional reactive programming will also be inherently different.
We propose investigating two alternative functional reactive programming languages for stochastic CRNs that parallel the two development approaches mentioned above.
The first will employ leader molecules to facilitate composing and

%     * Briefly introduce the stochastic CRN model and constrast its
%       unique qualities with the deterministic I/O CRN model
%     * Discuss the multiple approaches that could be explored to

%     A. Leader-Directed Functional Programming
%         * Draw connections to current literature on deterministic function
%           computation, leader election, and Turing completeness results
%           that often use leader molecules to direct the computation

%           Arrow implementations, etc.

\subsection{FRP and Probabilistic Signals}

To be written...

%     B. FRP and Probabalistic Signals
%         * Emphasize how both stochastic CRNs are inherently probabalistic
%           and how input signals are in reality, mapping time to a
%           distribution of possible CRN states
%         * Mention how the previously mentioned approach employs the leader
%           method to precisely control the ordering of events. In contrast,
%           biological systems oftem harness stochasticity to be a benefit
%         * We propose to investigate a more general approach to employ FRP
%           in this stochastic setting by regarding the signals of SCRNs to
%           be signals of "probability distributions"
%         * Since CSL is known to be a bisimulation for SCRNs, we will also
%           explore how a CSL type system may be employed to reason about
%           the complex abstractions of manipulating probability
%           distributions through FRP combinators
