\section{Tool Support for Functional Reactive Molecular Programming}
\label{sec:software_support}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Several software artifacts will be produced to aid in the proposed research and make the research accessible to the scientific community.  Such tools will support a cohesive and reliable environment for research and development of the FRP language during the proposed research, and provide end-user tools to researchers and molecular programmers.  As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:broader_impacts}, these tools may be useful in a more general context such as analog computing using FRP.

These software artifacts 

implemetned in visual studio code - others may work such as eclipse.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item IDE plugins support for CRN FRP.  Basic support for the framework  This includes ...  
	
	\item Compiler or translator to convert the FRP code to a CRN.  Export CRN formats.
	
	\item IDE simulator display
\end{enumerate}


% 5. Software Support for Functional Reactive Molecular Programming
%     * This may not need its own section
%     * Do not actually mention Cauldron
%     * Just mention that we propose to create a deliverable that
%       gives IDE tooling support for FRP in the MP context
