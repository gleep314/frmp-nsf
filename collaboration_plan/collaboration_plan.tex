        {\Large {\bf Collaboration Plan}}
    \end{center}

      The PIs Klinge, Lathrop, and Osera are assistant professors at Drake University, Iowa State University, and Grinnell College, respectively.
      These institutions are all located within a 50 mile radius of each other.
      These three individuals will assume overall supervision of the proposed research.
      PI Lathrop and PI Klinge have relevant expertise in the theory of chemical reaction networks, PI Lathrop has some expertise in the software engineering of chemical reaction networks, and also industry experience in the engineering of large systems.
      PI Osera has relevant experience in the theory of programming languages.
    
      Throughout the course of the proposed research PI Klinge will supervise 3 undergraduate students and PI Osera will supervise 2 undergraduate students each year at their respective institutions.
      PI~Lathrop and PI Klinge will co-supervise a Ph.D. student from Iowa State University to help with the proposed research and mentoring of undergraduate students.
      The graduate research assistant will maintain elevated communication levels with undergraduate students at Grinnell College and Drake University.
      This will help keep undergraduate students working on the proposed research focused and any questions or issues addressed quickly.
      This also gives the graduate assistant experience mentoring students under the supervision of PI Lathrop and PI Klinge.
      Two undergraduate research assistants from Iowa State University will also participate in the proposed research during summers that the project is active.
    
      Extensive use of audio/video conferencing and text based messaging services will be used by participants working on the project to communicate with other participants.
      It is anticipated that this informal communication medium will enhance the frequency and duration of interactions between collaborators at different institutions.
      Utilizing audio conference software, a weekly meeting will be held between all the participants in the proposed research.
      Also, the budget from each institution identifies funds for meetings at the other institutions' locations.
      The Iowa State University team plans to visit Drake University and Grinnell College each 3 times per year.
      Due to the teaching load and class schedules of students at undergraduate institutions, a reduced number of off-site trips are proposed for these institutions.
      These meetings will last most of a day and provide valuable face-to-face time for the participants in the proposed research to address any difficult or critical issues and present new ideas and results to others.
    
      The proposed research will utilize software servers and mirrored repositories at each of the institutions to share collaborative software, research artifacts, and publications.
